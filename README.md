# COMAP2019
Team project for the 2019 COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM).

## Motivation
Our team constructed a mathematical model to describe the spread of opioid addiction.
This model was then used to hypothesize if socioeconomic status has any effect on addiction status.
Lastly the model was used to identify possible solutions to combat this crisis.

The full problem description can be found [here](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/Problem.pdf); the census data provided can be found [here](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/tree/master/ProblemData).

## Results
The full results are discussed in the [Final Submission](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/Final%20Submission.pdf).
The data provided were analyzed using [R](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/DataExploration.Rmd);
the model was constructed and tested using [Julia](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/MathematicalModel.jl).

## Additional Information
Each team of three people has three days to research, construct, and test a model.
They have their choice of three problems (our team chose Problem C).
