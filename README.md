# COMAP2019
Team project for the 2019 COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM).

## Motivation
The full problem discription can be found [here](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/Problem.pdf); the census data provided can be found [here]().

## Results
The full results are discussed in the [Final Submission](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/Final%20Submission.pdf).
The data provided were analyzed using [R](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/DataExploration.Rmd);
the model was constructed and tested using [Julia](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/COMAP2019/blob/master/MathematicalModel.jl).
